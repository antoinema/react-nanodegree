# MyReads Project

This repo is the deliverable for the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

The MyReads app allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. In the MyReads app you can search more books from the API booksAPI.js provided by [reactnd-books-api.udacity.com](https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com)


## Project Setup
* clone the Project - `git clone https://github.com/antoinema/react-nanodegree.git`
* install the dependencies - `npm install`
* start the project - `yarn start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
